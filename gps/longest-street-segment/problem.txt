Challenge: Longest street segment
A point on a map is a pair of two values: X (longitude) and Y (latitude).
A junction is the intersection of at least two streets (M and N in the image below).
A street segment is a part of the street between two consecutive junctions and is described by the coordinates of the two junctions (A and B are 2 of the 7 segments in the image below)

Given a set of street segments in a city
Your task is to
write a function that finds the longest street segment in the city and prints its length to standard output (stdout). If the length is a float number, print it with only 2 decimals.
Note that your function will receive the following arguments:
segments
which is an array of strings with the following format: "x1,y1,x2,y2" where (x1, y1) and (x2,y2) are the coordinates that define a street segment
Data constraints
the number of segments given as input will not exceed 100,000
all coordinates are integer numbers
Efficiency constraints
your function is expected to print the result in less than 2 seconds
Example
Input	Output
segments: "1,1,2,5", "1,1,5,4", "5,4,6,1", "6,1,1,1", "2,5,5,4"
5.00
Explanation
The 2nd and the 4th street segments have both the highest length: 5.00
