Challenge: Speed
Speed is an important decision factor when matching GPS positions on the streets. For example - if you’re driving at high speed through a junction, chances are you’re continuing straight ahead.
Given a set of coordinates and corresponding timestamps
Your task is to
write a function that computes the velocity of the car in each of the points given as input (except the first one)
your function is expected to prints each computed velocity on a separate line to standard output (stdout) with a precision of 2 decimals
Note that your function will receive the following arguments:
positions
which is an array of strings with the following format: “x1,y1,ts” where (x1, y1) represent the position of the car at timestamp ts
Data constraints
the number of positions will not exceed 1,000
the timestamps are given as unix timestamps, measured in seconds
Efficiency constraints
your function is expected to print the result in less than 2 seconds
Example
Input	Output
positions: "1,1,10", "3,1,20", "4,1,30", "4,4,35"
0.20
0.10
0.60
