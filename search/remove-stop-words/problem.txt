Challenge: Remove stop words
Stop words are tokens which are filtered out from queries because they add little value in finding relevant web pages.
Given a list of tokens that were obtained after the search engine tokenized the user query using your code from the previous task and a list of stopwords
Your task is to
write a function that prints to the standard output (stdout) all the tokens in the user query that are not stop words (one per line)
Note that your function will receive the following arguments:
query
which is an array of strings giving the tokens in the user query
stopwords
which is an array of strings giving the stop words
Data constraints
the length of the query array will not exceed 1000
the length of the stopwords array will not exceed 1000
all string comparisons are case-sensitive (i.e: Cool != cool)
Efficiency constraints
your function is expected to print the requested result and return in less than 2 seconds
Example
Input	Output
query: “the”, “new”, “store”, “in”, “SF”
stopwords: “the”, “in”
new
store
SF
