Challenge: Query tokens stemming
Stemming removes word suffixes to reduce inflected (or sometimes derived) words to their base or root form.
E.g. “friendly” is an inflection of “friend”. By stemming (in this case stemming means removing the suffix “ly”), “friendly” is reduced to “friend”.
Given a list of tokens and a list of suffixes
Your task is to
write a function that prints to the standard output (stdout) all the tokens having their suffix removed if found in the list of suffixes (please print one token per line)
for each token if there is more than one suffix that can be removed please choose the one that is the longest
Note that your function will receive the following arguments:
tokens
which is an array of strings giving the tokens described above
suffixes
which is an array of strings giving the suffixes described above
Data constraints
the length of the tokens array will not exceed 1000
the length of the suffixes array will not exceed 100
all string comparisons are case-sensitive (i.e: Cool != cool)
Efficiency constraints
your function is expected to print the requested result and return in less than 2 seconds
Example
Input	Output
query: "friendly", "outgoing", "powerful", "in"
suffixes: "ing", "ly", "ul", "ful"
friend
outgo
power
in
Explanation
For the word “powerful” we can remove either suffix “ul” or “ful”, but we choose the latter because it’s the longest one.
