Challenge: Tokenize query
As soon as a user inputs a query, the search engine must tokenize it - that means break it down into understandable tokens. A token is defined as a sequence of characters separated by white spaces and/or punctuation.
Given a string representing a user query and a set of punctuation characters
Your task is to
write a function that prints to the standard output (stdout) all the tokens in the user query (one per line)
Note that your function will receive the following arguments:
query
which is a string giving the user query
punctuation
which is a string giving the punctuation characters that separate tokens
Data constraints
the size of the query string will not exceed 1000 characters
the size of the punctuation string will not exceed 10 characters
Efficiency constraints
your function is expected to print the requested result and return in less than 2 seconds
Example
Input	Output
query: "car? dealers! bmw, audi"
punctuation: "?!"
car
dealers
bmw,
audi
Explanation
The given punctuation characters above are question mark (?), exclamation mark (!)
