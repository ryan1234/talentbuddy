Challenge: Basic search query
It's time to retrieve the web pages that match a user query.
Given a query as a list of tokens and a list of strings representing the content of each web page
Your task is to
write a function that prints to the standard output (stdout) the number of web pages that contain all the given tokens in the same order.
Note that your function will receive the following arguments:
query
which is an array of strings giving the tokens in the user query
pages
which is an array of strings giving the content of each web page
Data constraints
the length of the query array will not exceed 10
the length of the pages array will not exceed 1000
the length of any web page content will not exceed 1000
all string comparisons are case-sensitive (i.e: Cool != cool)
Efficiency constraints
your function is expected to print the requested result and return in less than 2 seconds
