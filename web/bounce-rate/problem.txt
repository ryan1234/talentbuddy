Challenge: Bounce rate
The bounce rate is the percentage of users who arrive on the website but leave in the first 10 seconds of their visit.
Given the number of users who arrive on the homepage and their bounce rate
Your task is to
write a function that prints to the standard output (stdout) the number of users who didn’t leave the site after 10 seconds (i.e: the number of users who didn’t bounce)
please round the result downwards to the nearest integer (e.g both 7.1 and 7.9 are rounded to 7)
Note that your function will receive the following arguments:
n
which is an integer representing the number of visitors
b
which is an integer representing the bounce rate (i.e: the percentage of users who left the site in the first 10 seconds)
Data constraints
the value of n will not exceed 1,000,000
the value of b will be an integer number in the [0 .. 100] range
Example
Input	Output
n: 1000
b: 25
750
n: 835
b: 17
