Challenge: Growth
Given two integer numbers d1 and d2 representing the unique visitors on a website on the first and second day since launch
Your task is to
write a function that prints to the standard output (stdout) the word:
"Increase" if the number of unique visitors is higher or at least equal with the ones in the first day
"Decrease" otherwise
Note that your function will receive the following arguments:
d1
which is an integer representing the number of unique visitors for the first day
d2
which is an integer representing the number of unique visitors for the second day
Data constraints
the integer numbers will be in the [0 .. 1,000,000] range
Example
Input	Output
d1: 400
d2: 1000
Increase
d1: 1000
d2: 800
Decrease
Before getting started
Note that the code editor will provide you with the definition of the function (name & arguments). Do not add the common function "main" for the languages that usually require it
Make sure the words "Increase" and "Decrease" are capitalized
