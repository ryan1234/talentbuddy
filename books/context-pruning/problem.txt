Challenge: Context pruning
You’ve obtained the set of trigger words, congrats!
It’s time to remove the tokens that are not useful in predicting a book title in their vicinity from each context. This operation is called pruning.
Pruning each context is done in the following fashion:
select the token which is a trigger word and has the highest IDF (inverse document frequency)
if none of the tokens is a trigger word then ignore the context
if the token is on the left side of the context
we keep the token and all tokens on its right
for the right side of the context we keep only the first token (if exists)
if the token is on the right side of the context
we keep the token and all tokens on its left
for the left side of the context we keep only the last token (if exists)
Considering the list of trigger words [“Kindle”, “read”] sorted in ascending order by their IDF, pruning the context: Did you read -TITLE- on Kindle yesterday? will produce the following result:
read -TITLE- on
Given a list of contexts and a list of trigger words sorted in ascending order by IDF
Your task is to
write a function that prunes the contexts and prints the results to the standard output (stdout)
Note that your function will receive the following arguments:
contexts
which is an array of strings giving a list of contexts
each context is a string of tokens containing the keyword "-TITLE-" (separated by spaces) which delimits the left side of the context and the right side of it
triggers
which is an array of strings representing trigger words sorted in ascending order by IDF
Data constraints
the length of the contexts array will not exceed 1000
the length of a context string will not exceed 1000 characters
the length of the triggers array will not exceed 1000
the length of a trigger word will not exceed 100 characters
Efficiency constraints
your function is expected to print the requested result and return in less than 2 seconds
Example
Input	Output
contexts: "to read -TITLE- while in", "to buy -TITLE- while in school", "buy -TITLE-"
triggers: "read", "school"
read -TITLE- while
buy -TITLE- while in school
Explanation
The last context is ignored because it doesn't contain any trigger words
