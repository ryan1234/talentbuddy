Challenge: FizzBuzz
Given an integer number N
Your task is to
write a function that prints to the standard output (stdout) the numbers from 1 to N (one per line) with the following restrictions
for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number
for the multiples of five print “Buzz” instead of the number
for numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”
Note that your function will receive the following arguments:
n
which is the integer number described above
Data constraints
the maximum value of N will not exceed 1000
Efficiency constraints
your function is expected to print the result in less than 2 seconds
