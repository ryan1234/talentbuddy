Challenge: Common courses
A teacher wants to compare the performance of two students. To understand them better, he’s looking at all the other courses they took, but it’s hard to spot the common courses just from a glance.
Given two arrays that contain the course IDs of two different students
Your task is to
write a function that prints to standard output (stdout) all the course IDs that are contained in both arrays, sorted in ascending order, one per line
Note that your function will receive the following arguments:
courses1
which is the list of course IDs for the first student
courses2
which is the list of course ids for the second student
Data constraints
the length of the array given as input will not exceed 1000 elements
Example
Input	Output
courses1: 1, 2, 8, 4, 5, 8, 3
courses2: 8, 2, 2, 7, 10
2
8
