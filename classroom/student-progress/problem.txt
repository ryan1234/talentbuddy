Challenge: Student progress
Students are graded for their activity in each lab session.
It is expected that a studentâ€™s performance improves in time, which means that he should always receive a grade equal to or higher than the grade he received in the previous lab.
Given an array with the lab grades of a student
Your task is to
write a function that checks whether the grades received by each student are in ascending order
your function must print to standard output (stdout):
1 if the grades are in ascending order (e.g. 1, 3, 3, 7)
0 if the grades are not in ascending order (e.g. 1, 3, 7, 3)
Note that your function will receive the following arguments:
grades
which is an array containing the grades of the student
Data constraints
the length of the array given as input will not exceed 1000 elements
Example
Input	Output
grades: 1, 3, 3, 7
1
