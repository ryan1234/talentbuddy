Challenge: Mapper
To further increase the speed of the search algorithm, the entire set of documents and search strings is split into small chunks and sent to multiple machines.


During this phase, every machine solves parts of our larger search problem and delivers the results for synthesis to the Reducer.
Given a list of search strings and a list of strings representing the content of the documents
Your task is to
write a function that prints to the standard output (stdout) the list of documents matched by each of the search strings
for the list of matched documents you have to print the position of the document in the initial list (the first document has position 0)
for a given search string all positions of matched documents must be printed on the same line separated by a white space
if one string is not found in any of the documents please print -1
Note that your function will receive the following arguments:
searchStrings
which is an array containing the strings that need to be searched for
docs
which is an array of strings representing the content of the documents
Data constraints
the size of any string from the searchStrings and docs array will not exceed 200,000 characters
the size of the searchStrings and docs arrays will not exceed 1000 elements
all string comparisons are case-sensitive
Efficiency constraints
your function is expected to print the requested result and return in less than 2 seconds
Example
Input	Output
searchStrings: "buddy", "code", talent"
docs: "Hello, buddy!", "Do you have talent? Who's your buddy?"
