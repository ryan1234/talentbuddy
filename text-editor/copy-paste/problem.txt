Challenge: Copy-Paste
When writing text we frequently use the copy and paste commands. Letâ€™s see how an editor implements the paste command.
Given two strings S1 and S2 and an integer number P
Your task is to
write a function that inserts S2 into S1 starting with the position P in S1 and then prints the newly formed string S1 to standard output (stdout)
Note that your function will receive the following arguments:
s1
which is the string in which we must make the insertion
s2
which is the string that needs to be inserted
p
which is the position in s1 where s2 must be inserted
Data constraints
the strings will contain at most 1000 characters
Example
Input	Output
s1: "abcdefghi"
s2: "xyz"
p: 3
abcxyzdefghi
