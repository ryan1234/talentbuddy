Challenge: Sort words
Some advanced code editors allow programmers to sort the words from a selected block of text. This is useful when we are polishing our code to make sure everything is readable and consistent.
Letâ€™s define a word as any number of characters separated by spaces and commas. For example the string " one, ,two three,4," contains 4 words.
Given a string S
Your task is to
write a function that sorts all the words in the string alphabetically and prints them to standard output (stdout) in sorted order, one on each line
Note that your function will receive the following arguments:
s
which is the string from which you must extract and sort the words
Data constraints
the string will contain at most 1000 characters
Example
Input	Output
s: " one, ,two three,4,"
4
one
three
two
