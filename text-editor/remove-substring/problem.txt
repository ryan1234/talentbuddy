Challenge: Remove substring
Another common operation is deleting characters starting from the position of our cursor in the editor.
Given a string S, a position in this string P and a number N
Your task is to
write a function that deletes N characters from the string S, starting from position P
your function must print the newly formed string to standard output (stdout)
Note that your function will receive the following arguments:
s
which is the string from which we must delete the specified characters
p
which is the position in the string from which we must start deleting characters
n
which is the number of characters that must be deleted
Data constraints
the string will contain at most 1000 characters
Example
Input	Output
s: "abcdefghi"
p: 4
n: 3
abcghi
Explanation
The fourth character in the string is "d". Starting from this character, we delete 3 consecutive characters: "def", so the string that remains is: "abcghi".
